The real Windows PC-binded UUID getter means the tool to get the real uuid which binds to your PC, it can't be copied to other PC even if you do a system migration or copy.
This UUID is generated by Windows, and we get it with Powershell command `(Get-CimInstance Win32_ComputerSystemProduct).UUID`, that's all this program do.
